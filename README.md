We describe novel and common research areas in Gen AI and LLMs for 2025 and near future.

## Note #1 on Bold Recent Research Areas in GenAI/LLM.

There are many high-impact research areas in LLM work ‚Äî areas pushing boundaries, with big open questions, rapid progress, or potential paradigm shifts. In a series of notes, I will go through some of the most important research areas with huge impacts in Medicine, Marketing, Finance and so on. My effort is to highlight some important research areas that are more common introducing their main features/failure parts.

üí° Research Area (1): Reasoning beyond limits / multi-step & self-reflective reasoning.

LLMs are increasingly trying to not just spit out answers but reason through problems: multi-step chains, planning, inference-time scaling, distillation, Reinforcement Learning (RL) from human feedback, etc. There is work on how to get reasoning without explicit supervision (chain-of-thought supervision), or how to refine and correct mistakes through self-reflection. A recent paper ‚ÄúReasoning Beyond Limits: Advances and Open Problems for LLMs‚Äù surveys many such methods and discusses the challenges. 

While progress is strong, there exist several limitations and open questions:
‚úÖ Reasoning without explicit supervision: how to get models to reason well when you don‚Äôt have hand-annotated chain-of-thought (CoT) or step-by‚Äêstep labels. 
‚úÖ Error propagation in long chains: mistakes early in reasoning can cascade. 
‚úÖ Balancing structure vs flexibility: structured prompts (e.g. CoT) give guidance but can be rigid; too little structure leads to incoherent reasoning. 
‚úÖ Long context & external tool integration: when reasoning requires long memory, or access to external tools/data, current LLMs struggle. Retrieval or tool-augmented models help but integrating them smoothly is challenging. 
‚úÖ Computational cost and scalability: more compute (longer CoT, multiple candidates, RL) gives gains but at cost.
‚úÖ Evaluation metrics: how to evaluate reasoning? Just checking final answer may hide bad reasoning steps, hallucinations. Improved benchmarks need to test robustness, interpretability, and step correctness

## Research Area (2): Minimalist rule-based reinforcement learning for domain-specific reasoning (e.g. medical LLMs)

By ‚Äúminimalist rule-based RL,‚Äù we mean approaches that:
‚ùáÔ∏è Use reinforcement learning (or policy optimization) on large language models without requiring large human-annotated chain-of-thought (CoT) data or extensive distillation from closed-source models.
‚ùáÔ∏è Employ reward signals that are relatively simple and rule-based, i.e. rewards derived from explicit rules (e.g. correctness, format, consistency, logical constraints), rather than from expensive human reasoning traces.
‚ùáÔ∏è Focus on domain-specific tasks (e.g. medical question answering) where stakes are high, so reasoning quality is critical, but data cost and annotation cost are also high.

These methods aim to get emergent reasoning abilities (logical inference, step-by-step reasoning) with much less hand-crafting of reasoning data.

Work that shows strong reasoning ability emerging from RL with minimal external supervision or chain-of-thought data. For example, AlphaMed uses rule-based rewards to push medical LLMs to reason better on QA tasks, without relying on expensive human chain-of-thought distilled data. 

üîÜ This is bold because it suggests you can get domain-level rigorous reasoning with much less hand-crafted data. 

AlphaMed and similar works are significant because:
‚úÖ Cost reduction: Chain-of-thought data is expensive to collect and even more so to verify. If you can get strong reasoning without it, that reduces both annotation cost and dependence on proprietary models.
‚úÖ Interpretability: Rule-based reward functions are often more interpretable than black-box reward models or human preference models. You can see clearly why certain outputs are rewarded (format, correctness, logical steps).
‚úÖ Generality: The approach may generalize across medical benchmarks and possibly other domains, especially where you have multiple choice or constrained format QA.
‚úÖ Emergence: Reasoning behaviours can arise emergently from optimizing for task + rule constraints, even without being told ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the reasoning chain.‚Äù That gives a more scalable path.

Limitations / challenges:
1. Benchmark limitations,
2. Reward design risk,
3. Scale and domain shift,
4. Risk of overfitting to simple reasoning cues.

## Research Area (3): Latent state / Latent dynamics + behavioral models

What are latent states/dynamics and behavioral models? 
‚ùáÔ∏è Latent state: In sequential decision-making (agents, robotics, control, etc.), a latent state is a compact internal representation that retains just what‚Äôs relevant for the task (e.g. for planning, control, prediction), discarding redundancies.
‚ùáÔ∏è Latent dynamics: How that latent state evolves over time given actions and possibly environmental changes towards more efficient prediction, plan, explore and so on.
‚ùáÔ∏è Behavioral models --or large action & behavioral models (LAMs)--: These are models that not only observe, but generate or choose sequences of actions, often in a multimodal or embodied setting (robots, agents in environments). 

A few relevant works and initiatives that are examples of this research:
1. Microsoft Research: Large Action & Behavioral Models (LAMs)
2. MELD: Meta-Reinforcement Learning from Images via Latent State Models


üîÜ This area promises stronger generalization, more efficient learning, and better performance in embodied / real-world settings, but still has open challenges. 

Why This Matters (Promises / Benefits):
‚úÖ Generalization: By learning latent states that are task-relevant (control-endogenous) rather than observation-dense, agents can perform well in new or changing environments.
‚úÖ Efficiency: Planning, exploration, credit assignment become much easier when the agent reasons in a compact latent space rather than raw high-dimensional observations (e.g. images).
‚úÖ Better exploration & transfer: If latent dynamics are well modeled, agents can simulate possible futures or reuse dynamics across tasks.
‚úÖ Robustness to noise & irrelevant variation: Latent models help filter out what doesn‚Äôt matter (lighting, background, etc.) and don‚Äôt waste learning capacity on irrelevant details.
‚úÖ Scalable behavior modeling: For embodied agents, or agents that need to act over long horizons or with many modalities (vision, language, touch), latent dynamics + action models let scaling be more practical.


Open questions / challenges:
1. Discovering good latent spaces automatically,
2. Learning dynamics under partial observability,
3. Handling long-horizon dependencies,
4. Multimodality & embodied interaction,
5. Data efficiency / safety / real-world deployment
6. Interpretability

## Research Area (4): Fine-tuning efficiency, data selection, and privacy/ unlearning

What is unlearning in the context of AI and machine learning? 
‚ùáÔ∏è Machine unlearning: is the selective removal of data influence from a trained model, so that the model behaves as if that data was never used during training.
‚ùáÔ∏è Unlearning is crucial for: 
 - privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
 - malicious or incorrect data (data poisoning & errors)
 - bias and fairness in data
 - adaptivity & continual learning

Some relevant works and initiatives:
1. Machine unlearning using residual feature alignment + LoRA (Qin, Zhu, Wang et al.)
2. Invariance-regularized LLM unlearning (ILU) (IBM Research etc.) 
3. A general framework to enhance fine-tuning-based LLM unlearning‚Äù (GRUN) (Ren et al., 2025)


üîÜ The main goal is to enable practical, scalable adaptation and maintenance of large models for specialized tasks, while minimizing computational cost, preserving model performance, and enabling selective removal of training influence (privacy/unlearning) without full retraining. 

Why these are critical for practical deployment:
‚úÖ Regulatory/privacy pressure: Laws and user expectations require models to remove personal or sensitive data on request. If unlearning isn‚Äôt efficient, compliance may be too costly.
‚úÖ Cost/sustainability: efficiency in fine tuning and unlearning saves cost + energy.
‚úÖ Model drift/security: as data distributions or requirements change, being able to remove outdated / harmful / biased data helps maintain model quality and safety. Also avoids data extraction / membership inference attacks that exploit memorization.
‚úÖ Scalability & access: organizations without huge infrastructure benefit from methods that reduce the barrier ‚Äî e.g. using PEFT, selecting smaller curated datasets, distilling or pruning for deployment.

Open problems & challenges:
1. How to measure unlearning rigorously?
2. How to deal with heterogeneous data?
3. Interplay of unlearning with quantization/compression )(forgotten behavior or leak information).
4. Tradeoffs: as you remove data or reduce fine-tuning, maintaining model utility (accuracy, fairness, etc.) remains nontrivial.

Note #5 on Bold Recent Research Areas in GenAI/LLM.



The next most important current frontiers in AI agent and LLM research is:

üí° Research Area (5): Long-context, multimodal, and world models
Modern AI research is increasingly focused on expanding the scope and depth of what large language models can understand, remember, and interact with. This direction combines three powerful dimensions:

‚ùáÔ∏è  Long-context modeling: enable models to handle much longer input sequences (from a few thousand tokens to millions) so they can maintain memory of entire documents, conversations, or histories.
‚ùáÔ∏è Multimodal integration: make models understand and generate across text, image, audio, video, and 3D modalities simultaneously.
‚ùáÔ∏è World models: build models that internalize the dynamics of the real or simulated world, allowing prediction, planning, and action; beyond pure text generation.




Some relevant works:

1. Long-context modeling: #anthropic ‚Äôs #claude 3.5 (200K‚Äì1M token context)
#openaI ‚Äôs GPT-4-turbo (128K context), #google #deepmind ‚Äôs Gemini 1.5 (1M+ context window)
2. Multimodal integration: GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google DeepMind, 2024), Kosmos-2 (#microsoft #research)
3. World models: Google DeepMind‚Äôs World Model (DreamerV3, Gato), #meta ‚Äôs JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), OpenAI‚Äôs Video World Models


üîÜ The main goal is to enable AI agents that can perceive, remember, and reason across long time horizons and multiple sensory modalities, grounded in an internal model of how the world works ‚Äî ultimately allowing them to plan, act, and adapt like humans.


Why these are critical for practical deployment:
‚úÖ Longer context lets agents reason across entire projects, codebases, or days of dialogue ‚Äî critical for persistent, autonomous reasoning.
‚úÖ Multimodal LLMs are closer to human perception ‚Äî they can `see' and `hear' the world, not just read about it.
‚úÖ Agents that understand causality and environment dynamics can plan and act autonomously, bridging perception and reasoning.



Challenges:
1. Memory & scalability 
2. Multimodal fusion: aligning and reasoning across diverse data types 
3. Grounded understanding: connecting abstract knowledge to real-world physical dynamics and causal relationships.
4. Temporal consistency:  over long time horizons or across evolving contexts.
5. Data & simulation limitations 
6. Evaluation & alignment
